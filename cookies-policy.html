            <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
            <p>This Cookie Policy, together with our Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and any referenced documents, outlines our use of cookies. Like many reputable online companies, this site uses cookies. We encourage you, as a user of this site ('You' or 'User'), to read and understand this Cookie Policy for transparency about our use of cookies. Unless explicitly defined in this Cookie Policy, capitalized terms have the meanings assigned to them in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <h2>1. What is a Cookie?</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a small piece of information automatically stored by your browser on your computer's or mobile device's hard drive when you access our site. Cookies can only identify your computer or mobile device and not the individual user, as they store basic information that allows us to recognize if you have visited our site before. Cookies are read only by the server that placed them and do not transmit viruses or collect personal data. Their use is limited to the purposes stated in this section. In providing our services, we use session and persistent first-party cookies, as well as persistent third-party cookies. Session cookies are automatically deleted from your web browser when it is closed, whereas persistent cookies last until they expire or until you choose to delete them.</p>
            <h2>2. What Types of Cookies Do We Use?</h2>
            <p>We use first-party session cookies that automatically log generic information about your computer’s internet connection, known as "session data." These session cookies are temporary and are deleted when you close your internet browser. The purpose of these session cookies is to eliminate the need for you to repeatedly enter your information and to ensure our site retains your preferences. It is important to note that personal data provided by you, such as your name and address, is not collected or stored in the cookies placed by our site. Consequently, your information will not be shared with third parties unless explicitly stated otherwise. Additionally, we use cookies to track how users access our site, which is essential for compensating our affiliates.</p>
            <p>In specific cases, we incorporate third-party cookies, ensuring these parties are reputable and respect your privacy. Win Win Social Casino uses persistent third-party cookies set by Google Analytics to assess user interactions with our site, collecting information about clicks, time spent on pages, and page visits, among other metrics. This data is transmitted to Google Analytics solely for the purpose of improving our site. The cookie set by Google Analytics, identifying you as a unique user on our site, is used exclusively by Google. For more details, refer to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you when you return to our site by disabling cookies in your browser settings. These Google Analytics cookies may remain on users' devices for up to two years.</p>
            <p>We also use Live Chat cookies, which are persistent third-party cookies that collect personal information when you use our live chat service. This information includes your first name, last name, IP address, domain, browser type, and operating system type. For additional information, refer to our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, we may incorporate social media buttons and/or plugins on our site, allowing you to connect with your preferred social network. To function, the social network (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter) sets cookies through our site, which can enhance your profile on the respective social network site or contribute to their data for purposes outlined in their privacy policies.</p>
            <h2>3. How to Withdraw Your Consent</h2>
            <p>If we rely on your consent to process personal data collected by certain cookies, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@casinowinwingame.com" class="hover:underline hover:text-white">info@casinowinwingame.com</a></p>
            <h2>4. How to Control Cookies</h2>
            <p>Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser settings or use software programs to control acceptance. You have the option to disable cookies or configure your browser to alert you when cookies are sent. Blocking our cookies may disable certain features, but you can selectively block cookie activity from untrusted sites. You have the ability to control and/or delete cookies as desired - for more information, see AllAboutCookies.org. Deleting existing cookies and preventing new ones may require manual adjustments and may affect site preferences and functionalities.</p>
